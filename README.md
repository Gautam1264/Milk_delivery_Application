<h2> Milk Delivery Application </h2>

<p>In this project, I have created REST API's to manage the application.</p>
<p> Data form is 'x-www-form-urlencoded'</p>
<ul>
  <li> GET api which will take date as input and return all the orders of that particular date </li>
  <li> POST api which will take whole data as input and return the order id which can be used for editing/deleting the order </li>
  <li> PUT api which will take id and whole data as input and return the order id & will update the order details </li>
  <li> DELETE api which will take id and delete the order in the backend </li>
</ul>
